# I. Introduction to SQL

## Relational Databases
### Databases
Databases store and organize data electronically. It can store much more data than spreadsheet applications, and storage is more secure due to encryption. A relational database defines relationships between tables of data inside the database. Most of the relational databases use a language called SQL, or â€œStructured Query Language." SQL is the most widely used programming language for creating, querying, and updating relational databases.

### Tables
Tables are the main building blocks of databases. The rows and columns are referred as records and fields, respectively. A record is a row that holds data on an individual observation. A field is a column that holds one piece of information about all records. A unique identifier, sometimes called a "key," is just what it sounds like: a unique value which identifies a record so that it can be distinguished from other records in the same table. 

### Data Types
Listed below are the data types.
  1. String. It is a sequence of characters such a letters or punctuations where `VARCHAR` is very commonly used for storing strings.
  2. Integers. It store whole numbers where `INT`, a common SQL integer data type, can store numbers from less than negative two billion to more than positive two billion.
  3. Float. It stores numbers that include a fractional part where the `NUMERIC` data type can store floats which have up to 38 digits total - including those before and after the decimal point.

//Schemas are often referred to as "blueprints" of databases. A schema shows a database's design, such as what tables are included in the database and any relationships between its tables. A schema also lets the reader know what data type each field can hold. The schema for our library database shows the VARCHAR data type is used for strings like book title, author, and genre. We can also see that the patrons table is related to the checkouts table, but not the books table.

## Querying
Query is a request of data from the database. 

### Writing Queries 
Presented are few more commonly used keyword in SQL.
1. `AS`. Use *aliasing* to rename columns.
2. `DISTINCT`. Return a list of unique values.
3. `CREATE VIEW`. A view is a virtual table that is the result of a saved SQL  `SELECT` statement. It is the query code that is stored for future use.

## SQL Flavors
PostgreSQL and SQL Server are the two popular SQL servers.
1. PostgreSQL is a free and open-source relational database system
2. SQL Server is also a relational database system which comes in both free and enterprise versions. It was created by Microsoft.

### Comparing PostgreSQL and SQL Server
PostgreSQL: `SELECT id, name
FROM employees --
LIMIT 2; `

SQL Server: `SELECT TOP(2) id, name
FROM employees `

# II. Intermediate SQL

## PostgreSQL
The keywords are as follows:
1. `COUNT()`. Counts the number of records with a value in a field
2. `DISTINCT`. Removes duplicates to return only unique values
3. `COUNT()` with `DISTINCT`. Count the number of unique values in a field.

## Query Execution
### Order of Execution
*It makes sense that SQL needs to know where to"* `SELECT` *data* `FROM` *before it can* `LIMIT`* the results.* SQL code is processed differently than other programming languages in that you need to let the processor know where to pull the data from before making selections.

It's essential to know your code's order of execution compared to the order it is written in to understand what results you'll get from your query and how to fix any errors that may come up. Knowing processing order is especially useful when debugging and aliasing fields and tables.

Most common errors are misspelling, incorrect capitalization, and incorrect or missing punctuation especially commas.
