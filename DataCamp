# III. Joining Data in SQL (PostgreSQL)

## A. Introducing Inner Joins 
**Joining data**. Joining  is an essential skill which enables us to draw information from separate tables together into a single, meaningful set of results.
- `INNER JOIN`. Looks for records in both tables which match on a given field.
  a. `USING`. When joining on two identical column names, we can employ the USING command followed by the shared column name in parentheses. Here, since the join field is named "country" in both tables, we can use USING.

Syntax Example:
SELECT name, e.year, fertility_rate, unemployment_rate
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN populations AS p
ON c.code = p.country_code
INNER JOIN economies AS e
ON p.year = e.year AND c.code = e.code;

Syntax for performing an INNER JOIN. When selecting columns that exist in both tables, such as "country" and "continent", the table-dot-column_name format must be used to avoid a SQL error. 
1. After FROM, we list the left table, followed by the INNER JOIN keyword and the right table.
2. We then specify the field to match the tables on, using the ON keyword. Here, we use the "country" field.
3. Lastly, we add SELECT at the start of the query and choose the fields we want returned.
